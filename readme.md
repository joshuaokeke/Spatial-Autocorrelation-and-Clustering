# Overview
In this lab exercise, we explore various spatial statistics techniques using R. The exercise covers topics such as loading spatial data, data preprocessing and projection, spatial weights matrix generation, global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, Empirical Bayes estimates, correlogram analysis, and tests for spatial clustering and dispersion.

## Instructions

To run the lab exercise:

1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `Lab 6 Solutions.Rmd` file in RStudio.
4. Install any required R packages mentioned in the document.
5. Run the code chunks sequentially to execute the analysis steps.
6. Read the explanations provided in the document to understand each step of the analysis.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Loading Spatial Data**: The shapefile (`sids2.shp`) is loaded using the `sf` package's `st_read()` function.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Projection**: The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the shapefile is checked and transformed using the `st_crs()` and `st_transform()` functions.
3. **Spatial Weights Matrix Generation**: Queen contiguity and binary weights matrices are generated using the `spdep` package's functions.
4. **Global Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Global Moran's I statistic is calculated using the `moran.test()` function.
5. **Local Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) are computed using the `localmoran()` function.
6. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Moran's I is tested for statistical significance using the Monte Carlo simulation approach (`moran.mc()`).
7. **Empirical Bayes Estimates**: Local Empirical Bayes estimates are obtained using the `EBImoran.mc()` function.
8. **Correlogram Analysis**: Correlograms are generated to visualize spatial correlation patterns at different distance intervals (`sp.correlogram()`).
9. **Getis-Ord G and Geary's C Tests**: Getis-Ord G and Geary's C tests are performed to assess spatial clustering and dispersion, respectively.
10. **Visualization**: Various visualization techniques are employed to illustrate spatial patterns and statistical results.
